# 🚀 AI Career Coach – Empowering Fresh Graduates to Take the First Step

## 🎯 Problem Being Solved

Many fresh graduates struggle with uncertainty when entering the job market:

- They don't know which career paths fit their background.
- They’re unsure whether their current skills meet industry expectations.
- They often lack guidance in writing a compelling resume or preparing for interviews.

This project aims to bridge that gap using AI as a personalized career mentor.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. AI-Powered Career Suggestions
- Users can upload a resume (PDF) or fill out a guided form.
- The system uses AI to analyze their education, skills, and experience.
- It then recommends job roles that match their profile (e.g., Frontend Developer, Data Analyst).

### 2. Personalized Learning Path
- Based on the target job role, AI suggests free learning resources (YouTube, FreeCodeCamp, etc.).
- A custom roadmap is generated to help the user close their skill gap.

> _“Spend the next 3 months learning React, build 2 simple projects, and apply for internships in companies like X, Y, Z.”_

### 3. Visual Roadmap and Progress Tracker _(Planned Feature)_
- A visual breakdown of learning stages (Week 1–4, Month 1–3)
- Skill checkpoints, estimated time per topic, and career goals
- Option to save, update, and track progress
